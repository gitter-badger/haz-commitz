### A Github badge service conveying how recently a project has been worked on

Frustrated at having to check whether a github repository has had any commits recently, is it still maintained and can you use it? If the repository were to use a XXX badge then just a simple glance at the badge will give an indication whether the project is maintained.

### Usage

#### Project owner

Simply just add a XXXX badge to your repository README

```
http://this-badge-svc-host.com/repos/{owner}/{repository}/badge.svg
```

#### Project user

Checkout the repository's XXXX badge and make a judgement.

Click the badge and come through to our site for some more info about the repository and how we have rated it.

Do you want to use a repository that has not had any commits in 2 years? Maybe. Depending on the repo and use case but maybe not.

#### How we work out if the project is maintained

Beta app: Simply ask github api when the last commit to the master branch was and give it an un-scientific rating.
